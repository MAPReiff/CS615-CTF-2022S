Team: muppets

Passphrase: Horseshoe Crabs have blue blood due to the hemocyanin instead of
            hemoglobin used to transport oxygen.

Method:
- Oh boy, this one was tedious. So, we began by searching around the
  file system as our muppets user for anything of note. We found
  `/home/limulus`, the home directory of the limulus user which had the files,
  `tssb` and `instructions`, which were of note.
- There also existed `.procmailrc`, which contained configuration for the SMTP
  server, denoting that all mail sent to the limulus user would be sent
  through tssb.
- `.tssbrc` also existed, which was a configuration file for tssb, denoting
  that the password for emails would be `hemocyanin`. With this, we were
  pretty clueless with what to do next for like 2 days, as tssb's man page
  was not accessible to us. Eventually, however, this was fixed, and we were
  informed that we could retrieve the contents of `/home/limulus/instructions`
  if we sent a very carefully-formatted email to
  <limulus@ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org> with the subject containing
  `/home/limulus/instructions hemocyanin`, with the mail sent from another
  user on the system, `telson@cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org`. In order for
  any of us to actually get the email, we also had to add the header for
  directing the `Reply-To` to one of our emails.
- With that sent, we were informed that the passphrase for level 4 was
  somewhere on `/dev/bgfs`, encrypted with our keys.
- After reading the manpage informing us of the table of contents and the
  structure of the data on the file system, we then dd'd to our offset in
  the file system, specifically 197120.
- The first 4 bytes also told us that our secret was 1741 bytes long, so
  we grabbed the first 1745 bytes (size-inclusive) with `head -c 1745` and then
  trimmed the first 4 off with a `tail -c +5`
- With this encrypted file, we just decrypted it with any of our private keys
  and kaboom!: that ever so sweet passphrase right before our eyes.
- Also, we unfortunately learned of the quite sought-after blue blood of our
  crabby companions that threatens their livelihood.
