Passphrase: Naming things is hard: Horseshoe crabs aren't crabs.

Method:
- First, we generated a list of all IPs in the given CIDR and determined their
  FQDNs using the `host` command.
- After, we initially attempted to use `sha256sum` to hash each of these and
  compare, however that did not work. In the end, we found a tool to brute
  force the hash, using the previously found FQDNs as a dictionary.

- When we connected to the server using SSH, we used the hint about the
  Atlantic Horseshoe Crabs to determine the username was limulus and guessed
  that the password was the second part of the name, polyphemus.
- We then searched through the directories and found a file named `^Mlevel2^M` 
  in the directory `/homes/limulus/. /ðŸ¦€/` which we assume to be the required
  passphrase to advance to level2.
