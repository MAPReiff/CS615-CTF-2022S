Team: muppets

Passphrase: Horseshoe Crabs have 9 eyes.

Method:
- First, we discovered that we could use our team name, muppets, as the name
  for the admin portal.
- We learned that whatever file we uploaded had to be signed the same way we
  sign our READMEs, which meant that our usernames were linked to the muppets
  name on the server.
- While snooping around the source of the admin portal, we discovered there
  was a hidden input field, `dest`, which had the default value of `/var/www/pics`.
- Using, nmap, we also discovered an email server was running with SMTP advertised
  over port 25.
- We attempted to send emails to various possible users on the server, such as
  limulus, but we discovered each team also had a valid email user.
- Using this and the fact that SSH was also open, we discerned it was likely
  that each team had a user on the machine, where email and ssh connections
  could be acquired.
- This meant each team had a `/home/$TEAM`, where they likely had access to.
- A special file also exists under ~/.ssh known as authorized keys, which will
  allow any public key in the file the ability to connect to a machine without a
  password, so we put one of our keys in an authorized_keys file and uploaded
  it to the site using a script we threw together below:

```sh
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
gpg --sign --detach-sig -u 1F12F649CDF3266E13051BB8CB7DE04247ED7D7C --output sig.asc authorized_keys
curl -X POST -F 'team=muppets' -F "file=@authorized_keys" -F 'dest=/home/muppets/.ssh' \
    -F "sig=@sig.asc" 'http://[2600:1f18:400c:b800:92f4:ac6e:8a7f:669e]/cgi-bin/index.cgi'
```

- With that, we could SSH into the server and retrieve the passphrase for level 3.
