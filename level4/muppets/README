Passphrase: Horseshoe Crabs swim upside down.

Method:
- We began with the information that only connections from the part of the
  world where mangrove horseshoe crabs live, so we went to its Wikipedia page
  and found some of its areas of origin to be Hong Kong and Singapore.
- We tried using VPNs from those regions to no avail, so we reasoned we would
  probably need to connect from an AWS region from the same area of the world
  as the mangrove horseshoe crab.
- We then spent some time setting up a dualstack AWS instance in Mumbai,
  India, one of the other regions where the crabs are native to.
- Once we set that up, we connected to the level 4 URL as our muppets user
  and we entered our home directory.
- We spent some time trying to brute-force root with some random password
  ideas, but we eventually used the hint given from the MOTD to not be
  "dirty", so we looked for some privilege-escalation exploits related to
  dirtiness and found the dirty pipe exploit.
- This directed us to <https://github.com/0xIronGoat/dirty-pipe>, so we
  statically-compiled the exploit binary and ran the command
  `./dirty-pipe /etc/passwd 1 "$(sed 's/root/:x/oot:/' /etc/passwd)"`,
  followed by su, and we were greeted with a root prompt.
- With this, we then hopped around the system, where we found a binary in
  /home/limulus for uploading public keys. We followed the usage format and
  at first, we submitted our GPG public keys. Nothing occurred and we could
  not find any sort of encrypted files so we thought this public key required
  was most likely for SSH public keys, and not GPG public keys. We re-tried
  with our SSH keys and the corresponding GPG signature and the public key
  was installed.
- We now wondered what system this installation gave us access to.
- Given that the server left to infiltrate was the final server, we settled
  on the idea that the server our keys were installed to was
  <https://cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org/>. From running an nmap, we found
  port 2230 to be the one advertising SSH, so we ran
  `ssh muppets@cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org -p 2230` and we were
  provided with the passphrase for the final level:
  `Horseshoe Crabs swim upside down.`
